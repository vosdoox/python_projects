# Building a tip calculator

The final program should be able to calculate the tip each person in a group should pay when going to eat out together based on the number of people and the bill amount.
To begin with, it should greet the user and ask for a total amount of a bill. Then it should ask for a percentage of a tip they would like to give (choosing between 10%, 12% and 15%). 
After that it asks for the number of people in a group who want to split the bill. And finally, it calculates how much each person should pay.
