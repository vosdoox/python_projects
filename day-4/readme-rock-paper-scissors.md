The World Rock Paper Scissors Association (WRPSA):

> Rock Paper Scissors, commonly abbreviated as RPS, goes beyond the simple interactions of scissors cutting paper, paper covering rock, and rock crushing scissors. 
> This globally cherished game transcends gender, age, athletic ability, and other distinctions, leveling the playing field for everyone. 
> RPS is the go-to solution for settling disputes, determining who gets the last pizza slice, or assigning dish duty.

The goal of this project was to create a Rock Paper Scissors simulator. The rules of the game were officially documented by WRPSA:z
